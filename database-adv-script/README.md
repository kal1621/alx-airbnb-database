# Joins Queries for Airbnb Database

This repository contains SQL scripts for advanced querying in the Airbnb database. 

## File: `joins_queries.sql`

This file includes the following SQL queries:

1. **INNER JOIN**: Retrieves all bookings along with the respective users who made those bookings.
2. **LEFT JOIN**: Retrieves all properties and their reviews, including properties that have no reviews.
3. **FULL OUTER JOIN**: Retrieves all users and all bookings, even if the user has no booking or a booking is not linked to a user.

Each query is designed to demonstrate the use of different types of SQL joins as part of the ALX Airbnb Database Module.
